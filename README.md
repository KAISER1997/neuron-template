# neuron-template

## How to use

- Go to <https://github.com/srid/neuron-template> and click "Use this template" button
  - Select "Include all branches" (necessary to get the site to publish)
- Optional: In your new repository, edit the `neuron.dhall` file and change something (eg. the title)

GitHub will now build the site, which will become available at `https://<yourgithubusername>.github.io/<yournewrepo>/`.

## How to edit

Assuming you have changed the `editUrl` in `neuron.dhall`, you can simply click the "edit" icon on the publish site to edit any note. To create a *new* note, use the GitHub interface. On every change, your site should eventually rebuild.
